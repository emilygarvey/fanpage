                <h2>Houston is the perfect place for <br><a href="http://www.codenation.org" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> because...</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Houston is the fourth largest city in America with more than 2 million inhabitants.</li>
                    <li>Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, transportation, and healthcare.</li>
                    <li>Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits (after New York City).</li>
                    <li>Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major metropolis in the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Houston is home to many cultural institutions, exhibits, and visual and performing arts productions which attract more than 7 million visitors a year.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>But what about...</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Public transportation?</strong> Houston has an underutilized public bus system and a downtown Metrorail, both of which only cost $1.25 one way. Houston also has a large taxi and Uber fleet. Schools in Houston transport students through school busses and 15 passenger vans. Many students in Houston also receive their driver license when they are 16-years-old and are allowed to drive one other teen before they are 18-years-old.</li>
                    <li><strong>School partnerships?</strong> Houston has two large charter networks in the area (KIPP and YES Prep) along with many magnet high schools that specialize in different STEM or other career-focused fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech partnerships?</strong> Houston's diverse economy guarantees that there are enough large companies to find programmers to volunteer and placements for student interns. Houston has several different business districts where companies are located instead of just having one centralized downtown, which will make finding companies near students easier to manage.</li>
                </ul>
